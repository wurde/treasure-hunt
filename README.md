# Treasure Hunt

It's a maze requiring you to demonstrate **graph traversal/search**, solving puzzles in **machine code**, and mining coins from a **blockchain**. Pretty cool.

As part of a small team I competed against fellow students at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development) in a final Build Sprint. Our team created a solution that earned two members the top two places for gold farmed. To showcase our work we were invited to present during a Demo Day event.

Build Sprints, which occur at the end of each Unit, provide students with a unique, hands-on opportunity to **apply the skills** they have learned thus far. The hands-on experience helps solidify the content students have learned in previous Sprints.
